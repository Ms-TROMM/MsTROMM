Abstract: LG provides LG ThinQ applications to connect its home appliances and consumers and provide consumers with a better experience. The application allows LG's refrigerator, kimchi refrigerator, wash tower, washing machine, dryer, air conditioner, water purifier, styler, air purifier, dishwasher, and oven control with smartphones. Among these many home appliances, we would like to take a deeper look at the link between ‘LG TROMM Styler’ and ‘LG ThinQ’. ‘LG TROMM Styler’ is a home appliance that has been steadily loved by many consumers since its launch because it relieves consumers' discomfort with clothes that are worn every day but cumbersome to manage. LG TROMM Styler provides indoor drying functions, including basic clothing management functions such as steam sterilization, deodorization, and wrinkle relief. This 'LG TROMM Styler' allows you to use functions such as energy monitoring and smartphone remote control when linked to the 'LG ThinQ' application. We would like to propose software that can be used in addition to these applications. This software recommends specific functions of the styler and allows it to operate remotely. Specifically, the software recommends appropriate clothing or styler functions by referring to weather information and calendar information on the user's smartphone. This is expected to help users in their daily lives because it allows users to prepare clothes that meet the weather and schedule in advance.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Overall Introduction}
We are going to create this application with an emphasis on enhancing the value of LG TROMM Styler. Clothing functions as our second skin as one of the three basic elements of life, food, clothing, and shelter. We wear clothes every day and look at what the other person wears. In particular, it constitutes our egos through the process of choosing clothes and the habit of wearing clothes. Clothing is not only a basic purpose of protecting the body, but also a means of representing the value and status of the person wearing the clothes. Likewise, clothes are tools to complete humans, which are social animals.

However, it takes a lot of time and effort to manage the clothes to wear every day. Especially, in Korea, difficulties in managing clothing at home have increased due to air pollution such as fine dust. Due to this situation, the demand for clothing management devices at home increased, and in May 2011, LG launched the ‘LG TROMM Styler’ (hereinafter referred to as ‘Styler’). Styler is loved by allowing clothes to be managed at home for dry cleaning and shows high growth in sales rates. Furthermore, stylers are developing into comprehensive home appliances including indoor dehumidification functions as well as clothing management. 

In addition to this, LG increased device accessibility by linking its app called 'LG ThinQ' with a styler.‘ LG ThinQ’ is a representative home appliance management app that provides smart home services based on AI. With this application, you can control not only home appliances, but also all parts of the house, as well as check product status and malfunctions anytime, anywhere. In a situation in which the market environment is rapidly changing from 'supplier-centered' to 'consumer-centered, LG is providing these services, believing that the role of AI technology has grown.

However, we found that most users always worry in front of the Styler, "What should I wear tomorrow?" This is because they put clothes in the Styler to take full care of them for tomorrow schedule. In this situation, we have introduced an AI-based recommendation system(hereinafter referred to as ‘Ms.TROMM’) to Styler to reduce this time of concern and promote consumer-centered value. 

Ms.TROMM recommends modes that can be operated by the Styler, styling, and scent. First,  Ms.TROMM makes recommendations based on the user's calendar. By linking the calendar, Styler mode is recommended according to the user's schedule, and user can select the Styler operation by their preference. Second, Ms.TROMM uses the weather API to recommend suitable for the weather or a Styler mode that suits with weather. Third, Ms.TROMM identifies the clothes and the material of the clothes in the Styler and recommends the appropriate Styler mode and styling information for the clothes. Finally, data is accumulated through the process of receiving user feedback after all recommendations, and Ms.TROMM provides more sophisticated personalized recommendations. Through this, people can reduce their time of concern in front of the styler every evening or morning, and the need for a styler in our lives will also increase. Also, it is expected that users will be able to receive positive values for LG and styler if Ms.TROMM is installed in the ‘LG ThinQ’ application. We plan to create this application with an emphasis on increasing the satisfaction of styler users through Ms.TROMM, a system that allows users to use stylers and experience better.
\subsection{Problem Statement}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item There is an application called ‘LG ThinQ’ as a mobile application that can be used in conjunction with LG home appliances. We thought that it would be better if a recommendation function was included in this application
\item It is very useful to use a styler to manage clothes, but since it takes a lot of time to manage clothes, there is a time constraint to take care of clothes to wear right away in the morning.
\item Therefore, we thought that the styler could be used more effectively if there was software that knew the user’s schedule and weather and sent a message to manage clothes in advance.
\item The software recommends clothes that users will like in the future based on feedback on past users’ tastes and recommendations. In other words, it helps you to use the styler efficiently by controlling the past and the future at once.\\
\end{itemize}

\section{REQUIREMENT}

\subsection{Recommend appropriate styler functions for clothes that are alreaady in the styler.}
Ms.TROMM can identify clothes currently in the styler and recommend appropriate styler functions through interworking with the LG styler. The user can deliver the functions of the styler recommended through Ms.TROMM to the LG styler and request the LG styler for functions suitable for the material of the clothes in the styler. In addition, if the user learns clothes that are frequently used or preferred by the styler, and accordingly, the styler can suggest styling with these clothes or request the styler function according to the user’s usual styler usage pattern.\\


\subsection{Recommend clothes sutable for the situation in conjunction with the user’s calendar and weather information.}
First of all, Ms.TROMM recommends styling suitable for each situation for each activity such as meeting or hobby in conjunction with the user's calendar. For example, suits are recommended on days when meetings are scheduled. In addition, if you are scheduled for a picnic with your family on the weekend, you can recommend a combination of clothes for users and remind them of the schedule. Ms.TROMM can learn words related to the schedule and provide contextual recommendations even if the user writes down difficult or unfamiliar words on the calendar. In addition, after the recommendation, the user may be asked if the recommendation was appropriate and through the feedback process, the user may be provided with a better recommendation provided by Ms.TROMM.
Next, Ms.TROMM may propose styling according to weather information in conjunction with the weather API. In addition, if it is linked to LG's smart mirror, users' clothes can be registered in advance and registered clothes can be used. For example, on days when the daily temperature difference is expected to be large, thick knitwear among registered user's clothes is recommended, and styling is suggested accordingly. In addition, suits can be recommended on days when meetings are scheduled. In addition, if you are scheduled for a picnic with your family on the weekend, you can recommend relatively casual clothes among registered clothes using weather data. After the recommendation, the user may be asked if the recommendation was appropriate and through the feedback process, the user may be provided with a better experience to Ms.TROMM.\\


\subsection{Interworking with the user’s calendar and weather information to recommend scents suitable for the situation and the fragrance system of the styler.}
First of all, Ms.TROMM recommends a scent suitable for each situation in conjunction with the user's calendar, and if the user wants, the recommended scent can be applied to the clothes in the styler. For example, if it is determined to be a holiday through the user's calendar, Ms.TROMM recommends a warm soap scent that allows the user to spend the day comfortably. If the user likes the recommended scent from Ms.TROMM, the user requests the linked LG Styler for the desired scent, and according to the user's request, the LG Styler adds a scent that suits the situation.
Next, since Ms.TROMM utilizes the weather API or learns the situation, users can get recommendations for scents suitable for the situation recommended by Ms.TROMM, and can coat the recommended scents with clothes they want in conjunction with the scent system of the LG Styler. Users will feel more satisfied if recommendations can be made according to the advice of experts related to aroma in this process. For example, if it is predicted to rain through the weather API, "Today is a rainy day. On rainy days, I recommend the warm soap scent recommended by expert A. Do you want me to add scent to the clothes inside the styler? You can recommend it like that, and if the user agrees, "I put on a warm soap scent! It provides reactions such as "Have a good day" and adds scent to clothes through the linked LG Styler's fragrance system. Finally, the recommendation of Ms.TROMM can be more sophisticated whenever the recommendation process proceeds through feedback processes such as "Was today's recommendation accurate?"\\


\subsection{In conjunction with the user’s calendar and weather information, it is recommended to manage clothes suitable for the schedule and weather scheduled in a few days in advance in order to prepare appropriate clothes in advance.}
Since it takes a considerable amount of time to operate the styler’s clothing management function, in reality, operating the styler in the morning when you need to wear clothes immediately to manage your clothes is subject to many restrictions. So, Ms.TROMM recommends that appropriate clothes be kept in the styler and managed by referring to the planned schedule and weather forecast (about three days in advance). For example, if there is a meeting in three days, Ms.TROMM said, “We have a meeting in 3 days, so put your suit in the styler and take care of it in advance. It sends messages such as ~” to help users prepare clothes in advance\\


\subsection{Recommend that you take care of the clothes that have been in the styler.}
Ms.TROMM prioritizes management by scoring the clothes stored in the smart mirror on the basis of “the last day of putting them in the styler, the last day of wearing them, and the last day of disinfection.” And users receive clothing management messages according to these priorities. For example, Ms.TROMM told the user, “I haven’t put OOO clothes in the styler for 2 weeks. Are you still wearing it? I recommend disinfecting clothes” and “The OOO coat has not been in the styler for more than three days, but do you forget it?” And through the Ms.TROMM application, The priority score is displayed as a percentage so that the clothes that are most likely to need the management of the styler can be identified.\\


\subsection{Learn the home environment such as humidity and recommend appropriate functions such as dehumidification depending on the situation.}
Currently, LG Styler users can use a dehumidification function or the like through the Styler. Ms.TROMM can use this function to measure the environment (ex. Humidity, temperature, etc.) of the space where the styler is located and recommend functions (ex. Dehumidification functions, etc.) suitable for the environment through the user’s smart device, which allows users to easily control the styler.\\\\

\section{DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT }
\subsection{Choice of software development platform}
Our main development environment is Windows and MacOS. In the case of Windows, terminals that can be used even in windows such as Powershell were used to create a linux environment, and in the case of MacOS, built-in linux environment and terminals were used. Ms.TROMM in order for consumers to receive recommendations faster and immediately control devices such as stylers and smart mirror. Ms.TROMM was manufactured based on mobile applications. In addition, Ms.TROMM so that more users can use it in various mobile operating systems. The frontend framework of Ms.TROMM selected 'Flutter', a representative cross-platform framework. Currently, Google's Android accounts for the majority of global mobile platforms, and Apple's iPhone accounts for about 15\%, but Apple's iPhone users' consumption patterns and loyalty to electronics are quite different from Android users, and iPad, which accounts for a large portion of the tablet market, so the actual usage rate is very high. In fact, looking at the mobile operating system market share, including the tablet market, it can be seen that the proportion of iOS (including iPadOS) has increased by about 30\%. Therefore, we have adopted Flutter, a mobile/web/desktop cross-platform framework launched by Google based on the Dart Programming language, as a frontend framework, satisfying all of these demands and further considering future desktop applications. In the case of backend server, Python-based Flask, which implements artificial intelligence-based services and has well-established statistical and analysis packages, was adopted. Flask has the advantage of being easy to create API servers and very light. In addition, since Flask has a high degree of freedom, such as being able to change and respond immediately according to the purpose of development when there is not much time left, It was adopted because it was considered the most suitable web framework for Ms.TROMM development.\\ \\

\subsection{Software in use}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item LG ThinQ, LG SmartHome Application\\
    \centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.30]{thinkq.jpg}}

        LG Electronics uses the 'LG ThinQ', an application to control its smart home appliances. In addition, in the case of smart mirror, it can be controlled through the 'LG Smart Home' as a key home appliance for the smart home ecosystem that will be built as soon as possible. Through these two apps, LG Electronics will bridge users and smart devices so that users can monitor and control their homes anytime, anywhere. Our application is also an app to build a better ecosystem between users and smart devices. Our app is a smart assistant-like application that integrates the environment in which users use smart devices, checks minor things in advance that users may miss, and recommends the best way. \\ \\
    \\ 
    \item VSCode(Visual Studio Code) \\ \\
\centerline{\includegraphics{vs.png}}
VSCode is an open source-based text editor published by Microsoft. VSCode is a text editor, not an IDE, but has the advantage of being able to install various expansion packs. In addition, it has its own terminal function. Supporting various languages, The development environment for data and artificial intelligence technologies used by Ms.TROMM is excellent. In addition, VSCode was adopted as a text editor because of its excellent interworking with Git, a version control system.\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\
    \item Android Studio \\ 
\centerline{\includegraphics{as.png}}
    In the case of Ms.TROMM, since it is basically a mobile app, an integrated development environment (IDE) for mobile apps was needed, and Android Studio, which team members were relatively familiar with, was adopted as IDE. Both Flutter and Android Studio, which we adopted as the Frontend Framework, are platforms announced by Google, so they are highly interconnected, so there was no big problem in developing them. The advantage of being able to develop while checking the progress of the app through the UI is also the reason for adopting Android Studio. \\ \\
    \item DBdiagram \\ \\
\centerline{\includegraphics{DB.png}}
\\ It is a free, simple tool to draw ER diagrams by just writing code. So, the user can draw entity-relationship diagrams, painlessly. ERD is a very important development product because it can be used to see the model at a glance when implementing functions. Using this site, ERD can be configured through a code similar to SQL. If related codes such as tables and indexes are inserted without drawing ERD separately, ERD is automatically generated. It is also very useful because it can be modified based on code even when modifying.\\ \\ \\ \\
    \item Adobe XD \\ \\
\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{XD.png}
Adobe XD is an application for prototyping PCs, mobile Internet pages, and mobile apps released by Adobe. Since Ms.TROMM is a mobile app-based service, it was necessary to think about how users could feel the best experience when providing the app. Therefore, it is possible to intuitively prototype the operation of an Internet page or app operating in a corresponding environment through Adobe XD. In addition, the app development can be made easier by linking the prototype made in this way with Zeplin.\\ \\ \\
    \item Zeplin\\ \\
    \includegraphics[scale=0.32]{Zp.jpg}
    Zeplin is a software that helps designers and developers collaborate, and through Zeplin, you can convert design elements into development information (e.g., font, size, size, etc.). While developing apps through Zeplin, you can solve problems that may not be faithful to functional implementation while calculating design elements too deeply. \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\
    \item GitHub\\\\
    \includegraphics[]{Gtib.png}
 \\ \\ GitHub serves as a repository for Git, a distributed version control system. During development, several people go through a collaborative process of adding and deleting various functions, which can lead to confusion in this process without a version control system. Github is a web-based service that allows you to intuitively understand the team members' version control process. In addition, simple processes such as simply uploading and downloading files can be easily controlled using GUI tools such as Github Desktop. \\

% \subsection{Equations}
% Number equations consecutively. To make your 
% equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
% appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
% but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
% sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
% sentence, as in:
% \begin{equation}
% a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
% \end{equation}

% Be sure that the 
% symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
% the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
% the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

% \subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

% Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
% of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
% to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
% citations without having to go through the file line by line.

% Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
% \verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
% environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

% Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
% will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
% equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
% article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
% the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
% counting.

% {\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
% data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
% bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

% {\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
% subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
% referenced as Table IV-B3. 

% {\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
% \verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
% supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
% cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
% should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

% Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
% will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
% any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
% surrounding equation.

% \subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
% \item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
% \item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
% \item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
% \item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
% \item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
% \item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
% \item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
% \item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
% \item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
% \item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
% \end{itemize}
% An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

% \subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
% \textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
% minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
% should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
% next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
% and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
% affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
% example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

% \subsection{Identify the Headings}
% Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
% your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

% Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
% topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
% References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
% ``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
% table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
% style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
% down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

% Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
% example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
% material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
% sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
% and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
% should be introduced.

% \subsection{Figures and Tables}
% \paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
% bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
% figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
% below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
% figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
% ``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

% \end{table}

% \begin{figure}[htbp]
% \centerline{\includegraphics{fig1.png}}
% \caption{Example of a figure caption.}
% \label{fig}
% \end{figure}

% Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
% rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
% avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
% ``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
% units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
% with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
% \{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
% quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
% ``Temperature/K''.

% \section*{Acknowledgment}

% The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
% an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
% G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
% acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

% \section*{References}

% Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
% sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
% number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
% the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

% Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
% the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
% abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

% Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
% ``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
% submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
% that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
% Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
% element symbols.

% For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
% citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
