### Title: Ms. TROMM- Smart Secretary Styler using AI
----------
##### Proposal:
##### LG provides LG ThinQ applications to connect its home appliances and consumers and provide consumers with a better experience. The application allows LG's refrigerator, kimchi refrigerator, wash tower, washing machine, dryer, air conditioner, water purifier, styler, air purifier, dishwasher, and oven control with smartphones. Among these many home appliances, we would like to take a deeper look at the link between ‘LG TROMM Styler’ and ‘LG ThinQ’. ‘LG TROMM Styler’ is a home appliance that has been steadily loved by many consumers since its launch because it relieves consumers' discomfort with clothes that are worn every day but cumbersome to manage. LG TROMM Styler provides indoor drying functions, including basic clothing management functions such as steam sterilization, deodorization, and wrinkle relief. This 'LG TROMM Styler' allows you to use functions such as energy monitoring and smartphone remote control when linked to the 'LG ThinQ' application. We would like to propose software that can be used in addition to these applications. This software recommends specific functions of the styler and allows it to operate remotely. Specifically, the software recommends appropriate clothing or styler functions by referring to weather information and calendar information on the user's smartphone. This is expected to help users in their daily lives because it allows users to prepare clothes that meet the weather and schedule in advance.
