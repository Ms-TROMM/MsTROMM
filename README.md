### Title: Ms. TROMM- Wise Secretary Application with Styler
----------
##### Proposal:
##### LG provides LG ThinQ applications to connect its home appliances and consumers and provide consumers with a better experience. The application allows LG's refrigerator, kimchi refrigerator, wash tower, washing machine, dryer, air conditioner, water purifier, styler, air purifier, dishwasher, and oven control with smartphones. Among these many home appliances, we would like to take a deeper look at the link between ‘LG TROMM Styler’ and ‘LG ThinQ’. ‘LG TROMM Styler’ is a home appliance that has been steadily loved by many consumers since its launch because it relieves consumers' discomfort with clothes that are worn every day but cumbersome to manage. LG TROMM Styler provides indoor drying functions, including basic clothing management functions such as steam sterilization, deodorization, and wrinkle relief. This 'LG TROMM Styler' allows you to use functions such as energy monitoring and smartphone remote control when linked to the 'LG ThinQ' application. We would like to propose software that can be used in addition to these applications. This software recommends specific functions of the styler and allows it to operate remotely. Specifically, the software recommends appropriate clothing or styler functions by referring to weather information and calendar information on the user's smartphone. This is expected to help users in their daily lives because it allows users to prepare clothes that meet the weather and schedule in advance.

##### Introduction:
##### We are going to create this application with an emphasis on enhancing the value of LG TROMM Styler. Clothing functions as our second skin as one of the three basic elements of life, food, clothing, and shelter. We wear clothes every day and look at what the other person wears. In particular, it constitutes our egos through the process of choosing clothes and the habit of wearing clothes. Clothing is not only a basic purpose of protecting the body, but also a means of representing the value and status of the person wearing the clothes. Likewise, clothes are tools to complete humans, which are social animals. 
##### However, it takes a lot of time and effort to manage the clothes to wear every day. Especially, in Korea, difficulties in managing clothing at home have increased due to air pollution such as fine dust. Due to this situation, the demand for clothing management devices at home increased, and in May 2011, LG launched the ‘LG TROMM Styler’ (hereinafter referred to as ‘Styler’). Styler is loved by allowing clothes to be managed at home for dry cleaning and shows high growth in sales rates. Furthermore, stylers are developing into comprehensive home appliances including indoor dehumidification functions as well as clothing management. 
##### In addition to this, LG increased device accessibility by linking its app called 'LG ThinQ' with a styler.‘ LG ThinQ’ is a representative home appliance management app that provides smart home services based on AI. With this application, you can control not only home appliances, but also all parts of the house, as well as check product status and malfunctions anytime, anywhere. In a situation in which the market environment is rapidly changing from 'supplier-centered' to 'consumer-centered, LG is providing these services, believing that the role of AI technology has grown.
##### However, we found that most users always worry in front of the Styler, "What should I wear tomorrow?" This is because they put clothes in the Styler to take full care of them for tomorrow schedule. In this situation, we have introduced an AI-based recommendation system(hereinafter referred to as ‘Ms.TROMM’) to Styler to reduce this time of concern and promote consumer-centered value. 
##### Ms.TROMM recommends modes that can be operated by the Styler, styling, and scent. First,  Ms.TROMM makes recommendations based on the user's calendar. By linking the calendar, Styler mode is recommended according to the user's schedule, and user can select the Styler operation by their preference. Second, Ms.TROMM uses the weather API to recommend suitable for the weather or a Styler mode that suits with weather. Third, Ms.TROMM identifies the clothes and the material of the clothes in the Styler and recommends the appropriate Styler mode and styling information for the clothes. Finally, data is accumulated through the process of receiving user feedback after all recommendations, and Ms.TROMM provides more sophisticated personalized recommendations. Through this, people can reduce their time of concern in front of the styler every evening or morning, and the need for a styler in our lives will also increase. Also, it is expected that users will be able to receive positive values for LG and styler if Ms.TROMM is installed in the ‘LG ThinQ’ application. We plan to create this application with an emphasis on increasing the satisfaction of styler users through Ms.TROMM, a system that allows users to use stylers and experience better.
