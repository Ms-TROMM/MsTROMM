### Title: Ms. TROMM- Smart Secretary Styler using AI
----------
##### Proposal:
##### The ‘LG TROMM Styler’ is one of the household appliances that has been loved by many consumers since it was launched to relieve consumers’ discomfort about clothes that are worn every day but are cumbersome to manage. The ‘LG TROMM Styler’ provides more convenience to consumers by providing an interworking function with the ‘LG ThinkQ’ application. However, many consumers are uncomfortable that consumers should actively control the “high-priced stylers” and the application. Therefore, we propose the highly accessible ‘LG TROMM Styler’ and ‘LG ThinkQ’ application that is one step closer to consumers through artificial intelligence technology and recommendation system.
