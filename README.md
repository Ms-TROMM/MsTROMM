### Title: Ms. TROMM- Smart Secretary Styler using AI
----------
##### Proposal:
##### ‘LG TROMM Styler’ can be used in conjunction with an application called ‘LG ThinQ’. However, it seems that many people do not use this application. Therefore, we thought about ways to increase accessibility to the App.
##### We intend to develop AI technology that recommends how to use the functions of the styler in certain situations. First, by linking the weather with the application and clothes or scents suitable for the weather corresponding to a specific day are recommended. For example, I send messages through the app such as “I expect it to be cold tomorrow, so I recommend a coat” and “How about OOO scent on warm days like these days?” 
##### In addition, clothes or scents suitable for each situation are recommended for each activity such as meetings/hobbies in conjunction with the calendar. For example, suits are recommended on days when meetings are scheduled, and more casual clothes are recommended on days when hobbies are expected.
##### If you recommend clothes suitable for the weather and situation like this, we think more people will use ‘LG TROMM Styler’ in conjunction with the application.
